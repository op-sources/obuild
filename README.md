# 📦 tsbuild 😯

✅ Zero-config ESM/TS package builder.

Powered by [**oxc**](https://oxc.rs/), [**rolldown**](https://rolldown.rs/) and [**rolldown-plugin-dts**](https://github.com/sxzz/rolldown-plugin-dts).

The **tsbuild** project aims to be the next-generation successor to the current [tsbuild](https://github.com/Sunny-117/tsbuild).

- 👌 Focus on ESM compatibility.
- 🌱 Fresh rewrite with cleanups and removal of legacy features.
- 🚀 Using [**oxc**](https://oxc.rs/) (for transform) and [**rolldown**](https://rolldown.rs/) (for bundle) for much faster builds!

Some differences are not easy to adopt. Developing as a standalone project allows for faster progress and dogfooding in real projects.

## Usage

### CLI

```sh
# bundle
npx tsbuild ./src/index.ts

# transform
npx tsbuild ./src/runtime/:./dist/runtime
```

You can use `--dir` to set the working directory.

If paths end with `/`, tsbuild uses transpile mode using [oxc-transform](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oxc-transform) instead of bundle mode with [rolldown](https://rolldown.rs/).

### Programmatic

```js
import { build } from 'tsbuild'

await build({
  cwd: '.',
  entries: ['./src/index.ts'],
})
```

## Config

You can use `build.config.mjs` (or `.ts`) or pass config to `build()` function.

```js
import { defineBuildConfig } from 'tsbuild/config'

export default defineBuildConfig({
  entries: [
    {
      type: 'bundle',
      input: ['./src/index.ts', './src/cli.ts'],
      // outDir: "./dist",
      // minify: false,
      // stub: false,
      // rolldown: {}, // https://rolldown.rs/reference/config-options
      // dts: {}, // https://github.com/sxzz/rolldown-plugin-dts#options
    },
    {
      type: 'transform',
      input: './src/runtime',
      outDir: './dist/runtime',
      // minify: false,
      // stub: false,
      // oxc: {},
      // resolve: {}
    },
  ],
  hooks: {
    // start: (ctx) => {},
    // end: (ctx) => {},
    // entries: (entries, ctx) => {},
    // rolldownConfig: (config, ctx) => {},
    // rolldownOutput: (output, res, ctx) => {},
  },
})
```

## Stub Mode

When working on a package locally, it can be tedious to rebuild or run the watch command every time.

You can use `stub: true` (per entry config) or the `--stub` CLI flag. In this mode, tsbuild skips the actual build and instead links the expected dist paths to the source files.

- For bundle entries, `.mjs` and `.d.mts` files re-export the source file.
- For transpile entries, src dir is symlinked to dist.

**Caveats:**

- You need a runtime that natively supports TypeScript. Deno, Bun, Vite, and Node.js (1)
- For transpile mode, you need to configure your bundler to resolve either `.ts` or `.mjs` extensions.
- For bundle mode, if you add a new entry or add/remove a `default` export, you need to run the stub build again.

(1) For Node.js, you have several options:

- Using `node --experimental-strip-types` (Available in [22.6](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v22.6.0))
- Using [jiti](https://github.com/unjs/jiti) (`node --import jiti/register`)
- Using [oxc-node](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc-node) (`node --import @oxc-node/core/register`)
- Using [unloader](https://github.com/sxzz/unloader) (`node --import unloader/register`)

## Prior Arts

- [tsbuild](https://github.com/Sunny-117/tsbuild): Stable solution based on rollup and [mkdist](https://github.com/unjs/mkdist).
- [tsdown](https://tsdown.dev/): Alternative bundler based on rolldown.
